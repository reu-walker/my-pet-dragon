    <h1>Dragon's Make Great Pets</h1>

    <p>When I was first looking for a pet I didn't feel like a dog or cat was right for me. Instead, while roaming around Norway in search of the perfect companion, I stumbled upon what I thought was a giant peacock egg. I was very excited about this discovery. Upon returning home I realized that:
      <ul>
        <li>It was not a peacock egg.</li>
        <li>It growled.</li>
        <li>It was warm to the touch</li>
      </ul>
    When it finally did hatch I was disappointed to discover that it wasn't a peacock but was elated to find that it was actually a dragon instead!</p>

    <p> My life has been considerably more interesting since finding my dragon pet. So far I've managed to have a normal pet owner life but I'm sure that things will get more complicated as the dragon gets bigger.</p>

    <p>If I ever need you to come over and petsit the dragon, there are a few things <a href="dragon-petsitting-needs.html">you need to know.</a>
